A top strength of mine is that I am adaptable, which means I adapt to my surroundings and situations. A time I showed this strength was when I was asked to manage an office and I didnt have experience in some of the departments. So I learned quickly so I would be able to effectively run the branch.

One thing I'm actively improving on is patience, because I want to recognize that sometimes it's harder for everything to go as smoothly as I believe it should. 

In my life so far, I'm the most proud of being a mother, because it taught me how to be strong, reliable, and empathetic. It taught me that with hard work, care and strength anything is possible and most problems can be overcome. 

One challenge I worked hard to overcome was learning when to let go and ask for help and it taught me sometimes there are things we cannot fix alone and sometimes being a team is the best way to be.

My adaptability is what makes me unique because it helps me to be able to adjust to any situation and I use this to help others in situations by being able to adjust how I am doing things to assist in what they are doing and find solutions.
